The sources can't be exported with the Google Fonts tools (fontmaker and gftools builder). The principal blockers are:
- masters names
- special layers (not supported by GlyphsLib)
- smart and corner components (not supported by GlyphsLib)


On the .glyphs files, to do each time we want to export the fonts:

About fonts infos:

- Rename files names (same name as in the config.yaml)
- Fonts infos: (copyright, licence, variable font origin, axis mapping, remove italic axis). Check or copy/paste the previous version infos.
- Rename masters. Example: Needlepoint SemiCondensed Upright -> 1200pt SemiCondensed Light
- Change 113 to 114 for master values (width)
- Copy paste right instances (from the previous file)
- Win metrics to update
- Add '# Automatic Code Start' in features, see: https://github.com/googlefonts/fontmake/issues/1137#issuecomment-2508122490



About outlines:
- Delete all the corner components and choose "decompose" (it changed some of the metrics)
- Decomposed a part of Th.ss10, that were causing interpolation issue.
- Decomposed _LC-descender-wide-normal
- Decomposed bhook/bstroke/lambdastroke-latin/u/Zhe-cy/Tshe-cy/Zhedescender-cy/Tshe-cy.ss07/zhe-cy.smcp/tshe-cy.smcp/zhedescender-cy.smcp/tshe-cy.smcp.ss07/Tshe-cy.BRACKET.varAlt01/Tshe-cy.ss07.BRACKET.varAlt01/tshe-cy.smcp.BRACKET.varAlt01/tshe-cy.smcp.ss07.BRACKET.varAlt01
- Removed all the smart components + decomposed the corresponding glyphs
- Removed and decomposed:
- _SMCP-ka-cy-wings _SMCP-kadescender-cy-wings _SMCP-zhe-cy-wings _SMCP-zhedescender-cy-wings _UC-Zhe-cy-wings _UC-Zhedescender-cy-wings _UC-K-wing _UC-Ka-cy-wings _UC-Kadescender-cy-wing 
- Same in Italic + removed brace layers in Ñª/yusbig-cy.smcp
- Removed all brace layers


Fix fontbakery fails:
- Win metrics
- slashshort and slashlong non exported
- remove soft hyphen
- caret ligature
- Check anchors and add missing anchors
